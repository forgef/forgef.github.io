### Description:

<p align="justify">
I hold a Ph.D. in economics with over 6 years of experience in quantitative methods and data science. I currently teach these tools as a lecturer of data science and machine learning at the University of Ottawa and statistics for causal inference at McGill University. I am also working as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Ottawa where I use deep learning to map changes in urban canopy for large Canadian cities and statistics to measure the impact of proximity to trees on income and health.<br>


I am currently looking for new opportunities to use my practical experience with data and my strong theoretical background in statistics.
